# Multi-Period Distributed Optimal Power Flow
## Optimization for Balanced Three-Phase Power Distribution Networks with Renewables and Storage in MATLAB. 

Now working on solving for a Naive Brute Force Multi-Period OPF. Currently a Centrlized MPOPF has been implemented, with a decentralized MPOPF in the pipeline.
