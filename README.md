# Multi-Period Distributed Optimal Power Flow
## Optimization for Balanced Three-Phase Power Distribution Networks with Renewables and Storage in MATLAB. 

Right now it's not really Multi-Period Optimization. It's a sequence of greedy optimizations. So obviously, batteries are not incentivized to charge at all. But it's a good start.
Now working on solving for a Naive Brute Force Multi-Period OPF.
